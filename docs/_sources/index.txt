About
=====

This version of Django Site Broadcasts was forked to provide a way to schedule client-side messages:

    * Across the whole site or on specific pages
    * For a specified amount of time
    * Uses a cookie to mark that the message was shown
    * For all users, authenticated users only, or unauthenticated users only
    * Retrievable via AJAX to allow for page caching
